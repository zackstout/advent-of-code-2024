# Advent of Code 2024

Goal for this year: Finish every problem. No copilot. Just me writing code.

(But I can peek at other people's solutions if I get really stuck. I'll learn a few things.)

Here is the [problem set](https://adventofcode.com/2024).

## --- Day 1: Historian Hysteria ---

Sorting and frequency count.

- [x] Part 1
- [x] Part 2

## --- Day 2: Red-Nosed Reports ---

Monotonic arrays.

- [x] Part 1
- [x] Part 2

## --- Day 3: Mull It Over ---

Regex!

- [x] Part 1
- [x] Part 2

## --- Day 4: Ceres Search ---

Word search in grid.

- [x] Part 1
- [x] Part 2

## --- Day 5: Print Queue ---

Ensure lists are in proper order.

- Used topological sort for part two
- [x] Part 1
- [x] Part 2

## --- Day 6: Guard Gallivant ---

Path simulation for guard. Determine where to add obstacles to create a looping path for part 2.

- [x] Part 1
- [x] Part 2

## --- Day 7: Bridge Repair ---

Multiple choices for operators trying to make a target number, fun use of binary/ternary.

- [x] Part 1
- [x] Part 2

## --- Day 8: Resonant Collinearity ---

Finding positions of antinodes given certain transmitting antennae positions.

- [x] Part 1
- [x] Part 2

## --- Day 9: Disk Fragmenter ---

Compact a hard disk (process simulation).

- [x] Part 1
- [x] Part 2

## --- Day 10: Hoof It ---

Find valid paths from "0" to "9" in a grid of numbers (trails that only increase by 1 elevation) -- use BFS.

- [x] Part 1
- [x] Part 2

## --- Day 11: Plutonian Pebbles ---

Brute force finally fails. Use frequency counts to speed up simulation.

- [x] Part 1
- [x] Part 2

## --- Day 12: Garden Groups ---

Find areas and perimeters of regions -- tough part 2 (counting sides of a region).

- [x] Part 1
- [x] Part 2

## --- Day 13: Claw Contraption ---

Nice application of Cramer's rule and linear algebra to solve systems of equations.

- [x] Part 1
- [x] Part 2

## --- Day 14: Restroom Redoubt ---

Particle simulation (with positions and velocity info)!

- [x] Part 1
- [x] Part 2

## --- Day 15: Warehouse Woes ---

Box-pushing simulation!

- [x] Part 1
- [x] Part 2

## --- Day 16: Reindeer Maze ---

Tough path-finding (through grid of obstacles) with costs.
